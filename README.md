## My process

I use VS code IDE for this project and HTML, CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Image map for QR-code

### What I learned

here i get learn how to use map in HTML image , how to find coordinates etc.

code snippets, see below:

```html
<img
  src="./images/image-qr-code.png"
  alt="image-qr-code"
  usemap="#QR_code"
  width="300"
  height="300"
/>
<map name="QR_code">
  <area
    shape="rect"
    coords="65,65, 230, 230"
    href="https://www.frontendmentor.io?ref=challenge"
/></map>
```

### Continued development

By implementing the skills , I've gained a lot of knowledge. I plan to continue this learning-by-doing approach as I work on my next project from the Frontend Mentor site.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me to use map and area elements
